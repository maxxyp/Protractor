End-to-End Testing with Protractor JS course files
==========

[Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor) is an end-to-end test framework for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) applications. Protractor is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) program built on top of [WebDriverJS](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs). Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.

Please note Jasmine framework, its resolve promises internally, when we use expect statement.
But cucumberjs does not have the capability, so we have to rely on the this libarary chai-as-promise,
inother to resolve our promises.

npm install chai --save
npm install chai-as-promised


When you are executing a website that is asynchronous, you need to add a callback function

Protractor is a node package manager, so to install it, you do => npm install -g protractor

Clone repo:
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/centner/udemy-protractor.git
```

You can use npm to install Protractor globally with:
```
npm install -g protractor
```

...or after cloning inside project folder execute: (that will install all dependencies from package.json)
```
npm i
```

The webdriver-manager is a helper tool to easily get an instance of a Selenium Server running. Use it to download the necessary binaries with:
```
webdriver-manager update ==> This will update the browsers to the latest.
webdriver-manager start

webdriver-manager update --versions.chrome 2.40 ==> This will update all the browsers. Browsers executable (chromedriver, geckodriver all we be downloaded)
webdriver-manager start --versions.chrome 2.40
```
Running Tests
-------------
Tests need to be run from the project directory inside the udemy-protractor:
```
cd project-path
```
Run Selenium in one tab via:
```
webdriver-manager start
```

Once the Selenium server is running, run this command in another tab:
```
npm start OR protractor config.js
```


To Run a particular test
```
protractor config.js --suite login
```


It is possible to run tests by test suites/groups separately:

```
protractor config.js --suite home
protractor config.js --suite cart
```
